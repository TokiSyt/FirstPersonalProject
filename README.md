This is my first personal project from zero. 

It is a small demo for my capstone project, which will be an App made with different languages (this one will only use 1).
The main goal for both projects is to help my partner with her profissional life and train visual interactions (GUI apps). Meaning, all the tasks she has to do either manually or semi-automatically will be held there. I don't plan at all to use this demo as a resume project nor portfolio, being the reason I'm being so honest about it here.

Most of the systems below will be heavly upgraded both on performance \ features and visuals, as it's not my big goal right now and the number of different systems will also increase greatly, as some of them will need better visual tools to work.

Systems:
- Wheel.
: Let's you choose a stored list (or create one) of names that you can edit/delete/read and will output 1 name per spin. There will be the option to have it pop the output from the list or not.
PS: You will need a folder names "lists" and inside a folder named "#index.json" to use the program correctly.

- Grade calculator. 
: Calculates the exact value, integral or decimal, for each grade (0 - 5) in the Czech Schoolar System. 
Very useful since here tests have different maximum amount of points and each school has different % for each grade, although they do follow a certain range defined by law.

- Burger Shop.
: A burguer shop using tkinter and it's frames. You can order inside of the store, on the drive through or check the credits.
